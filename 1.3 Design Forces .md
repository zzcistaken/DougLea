This section surveys design concerns that arise in concurrent software development, but play at best
minor roles in sequential programming. Most presentations of constructions and design patterns later
in this book include descriptions of how they resolve applicable forces discussed here (as well as
others that are less directly tied to concurrency, such as accuracy, testability, and so on).
