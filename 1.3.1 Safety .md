Safe concurrent programming practices are generalizations of safe and secure sequential programming
practices. Safety in concurrent designs adds a temporal dimension to common notions of type safety. 

A type-checked program might not be correct, but at least it doesn't do dangerous things like
misinterpret the bits representing a float as if they were an object reference. Similarly, a safe
concurrent design might not have the intended effect, but at least it never encounters errors due to
corruption of representations by contending threads. 

One practical difference between type safety and multithreaded safety is that most type-safety matters
can be checked automatically by compilers. A program that fails to pass compile-time checks cannot
even be run. Most multithreaded safety matters, however, cannot be checked automatically, and so
must rely on programmer discipline. Methods for proving designs to be safe fall outside the scope of
this book (see the Further Readings). The techniques for ensuring safety described here rely on careful
engineering practices (including several with roots in formalisms) rather than formal methods
themselves. 

Multithreaded safety also adds a temporal dimension to design and programming techniques
surrounding security. Secure programming practices disable access to certain operations on objects
and resources from certain callers, applications, or principals. Concurrency control introduces
transient disabling of access based on consideration of the actions currently being performed by other
threads.
