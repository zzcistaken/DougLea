This book discusses some ways of thinking about, designing, and implementing concurrent programs
in the Java™ programming language. Most presentations in this book assume that you are an
experienced developer familiar with object-oriented (OO) programming, but have little exposure to
concurrency. Readers with the opposite background — experience with concurrency in other
languages — may also find this book useful.
