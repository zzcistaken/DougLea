This section introduces basic concurrency support constructs by example and then proceeds with a
walk-through of the principal methods of class Thread. Other concurrency constructs are briefly 
described as they are introduced, but full technical details are postponed to later chapters (mainly §
2.2.1 and § 3.2.2). Also, concurrent programs often make use of a few ordinary Java programming
language features that are not as widely used elsewhere. These are briefly reviewed as they arise.

1.1.1 A Particle Applet

ParticleApplet is an Applet that displays randomly moving particles. In addition to
concurrency constructs, this example illustrates a few of the issues encountered when using threads
with any GUI-based program. The version described here needs a lot of embellishment to be visually
attractive or realistic. You might enjoy experimenting with additions and variations as an exercise.

As is typical of GUI-based programs, ParticleApplet uses several auxiliary classes that do
most of the work. We'll step through construction of the Particle and ParticleCanvas
classes before discussing ParticleApplet.

1.1.1.1 Particle 
----

The Particle class defines a completely unrealistic model of movable bodies. Each particle is
represented only by its (x, y) location. Each particle also supports a method to randomly change its
location and a method to draw itself (as a small square) given a supplied java.awt.Graphics
object. 

realistic 英 [rɪə'lɪstɪk] adj. 现实的；现实主义的；逼真的；实在论的

While Particle objects do not themselves exhibit any intrinsic concurrency, their methods may be
invoked across multiple concurrent activities. When one activity is performing a move and another is
invoking draw at about the same time, we'd like to make sure that the draw paints an accurate
representation of where the Particle is. Here, we require that draw uses the location values
current either before or after the move. For example, it would be conceptually wrong for a draw
operation to display using the y-value current before a given move, but the x-value current after the
move. If we were to allow this, then the draw method would sometimes display the particle at a
location that it never actually occupied. 

exhibit 美 [ɪɡ'zɪbɪt] 展览；显示；提出
intrinsic 英 [ɪn'trɪnsɪk] adj. 本质的，固有的

This protection can be obtained using the synchronized keyword, which can modify either a
method or a block of code. Every instance of class Object (and its subclasses) possesses a lock that
is obtained on entry to a synchronized method and automatically released upon exit. The codeblock version 
works in the same way except that it takes an argument stating which object to lock. The
most common argument is this, meaning to lock the object whose method is executing. When a
lock is held by one thread, other threads must block waiting for the holding thread to release the lock.
Locking has no effect on non-synchronized methods, which can execute even if the lock is being held
by another thread. 

Locking provides protection against both high-level and low-level conflicts by enforcing atomicity
among methods and code-blocks synchronized on the same object. Atomic actions are
performed as units, without any interleaving of the actions of other threads. But, as discussed in §
1.3.2 and in Chapter 2, too much locking can also produce liveness problems that cause programs to
freeze up. Rather than exploring these issues in detail now, we'll rely on some simple default rules for
writing methods that preclude interference problems: 

interleave 英 [ɪntə'liːv] vt. [计] 交错；插空白页于；插叙
preclude 英 [prɪ'kluːd] vt. 排除；妨碍；阻止

• Always lock during updates to object fields.
• Always lock during access of possibly updated object fields.
• Never lock when invoking methods on other objects.

These rules have many exceptions and refinements, but they provide enough guidance to write class
Particle:
import java.util.Random;
class Particle {
 protected int x;
 protected int y;
 protected final Random rng = new Random();
 public Particle(int initialX, int initialY) {
 x = initialX;
 y = initialY;
 }
 public synchronized void move() {
 x += rng.nextInt(10) - 5;
 y += rng.nextInt(20) - 10;
 }
 public void draw(Graphics g) {
 int lx, ly;
 synchronized (this) { lx = x; ly = y; }
 g.drawRect(lx, ly, 10, 10);
 }
}

Notes:
• The use of final in the declaration of the random number generator rng reflects our
decision that this reference field cannot be changed, so it is not impacted by our locking rules.
Many concurrent programs use final extensively, in part as helpful, automatically
enforced documentation of design decisions that reduce the need for synchronization (see §
2.1).
• The draw method needs to obtain a consistent snapshot of both the x and y values. Since a
single method can return only one value at a time, and we need both the x and y values here,
we cannot easily encapsulate the field accesses as a synchronized method. We instead
use a synchronized block. (See § 2.4 for some alternatives.)
• The draw method conforms to our rule of thumb to release locks during method invocations
on other objects (here g.drawRect). The move method appears to break this rule by
calling rng.nextInt. However, this is a reasonable choice here because each
Particle confines its own rng — conceptually, the rng is just a part of the
Particle itself, so it doesn't count as an "other" object in the rule. Section § 2.3 describes
more general conditions under which this sort of reasoning applies and discusses factors that
should be taken into account to be sure that this decision is warranted. 

conform 英 [kən'fɔːm] vi. 符合；遵照；适应环境

1.1.1.2 ParticleCanvas 
----

ParticleCanvas is a simple subclass of java.awt.Canvas that provides a drawing area
for all of the Particles. Its main responsibility is to invoke draw for all existing particles
whenever its paint method is called. 

However, the ParticleCanvas itself does not create or manage the particles. It needs either to
be told about them or to ask about them. Here, we choose the former. 

The instance variable particles holds the array of existing Particle objects. This field is set
when necessary by the applet, but is used in the paint method. We can again apply our default
rules, which in this case lead to the creation of little synchronized get and set methods (also
known as accessor and assignment methods) for particles, otherwise avoiding direct access of
the particles variable itself. To simplify and to enforce proper usage, the particles field is
never allowed to be null. It is instead initialized to an empty array: 

class ParticleCanvas extends Canvas {
  private Particle[] particles = new Particle[0];
  
  ParticleCanvas(int size) {
    setSize(new Dimension(size, size));
  }
  
  // intended to be called by applet
  protected synchronized void setParticles(Particle[] ps) {
    if (ps == null)
      throw new IllegalArgumentException("Cannot set null");
    particles = ps;
  } 
 
  protected synchronized Particle[] getParticles() {
    return particles;
  }
  
  public void paint(Graphics g) { // override Canvas.paint
    Particle[] ps = getParticles();
    for (int i = 0; i < ps.length; ++i)
    ps[i].draw(g);
  }
} 



----
1.1.1.3 ParticleApplet 
----

The Particle and ParticleCanvas classes could be used as the basis of several different
programs. But in ParticleApplet all we want to do is set each of a collection of particles in
autonomous "continuous" motion and update the display accordingly to show where they are. To
comply with standard applet conventions, these activities should begin when Applet.start is
externally invoked (normally from within a web browser), and should end when Applet.stop is
invoked. (We could also add buttons allowing users to start and stop the particle animation
themselves.) 

There are several ways to implement all this. Among the simplest is to associate an independent loop
with each particle and to run each looping action in a different thread.

Actions to be performed within new threads must be defined in classes implementing
java.lang.Runnable. This interface lists only the single method run, taking no arguments,
returning no results, and throwing no checked exceptions: 

public interface java.lang.Runnable {
 void run();
} 

An interface encapsulates a coherent set of services and attributes (broadly, a role) without
assigning this functionality to any particular object or code. Interfaces are more abstract than classes
since they say nothing at all about representations or code. All they do is describe the signatures
(names, arguments, result types, and exceptions) of public operations, without even pinning down the
classes of the objects that can perform them. The classes that can support Runnable typically have
nothing in common except that they contain a run method. 

Each instance of the Thread class maintains the control state necessary to execute and manage the
call sequence comprising its action. The most commonly used constructor in class Thread accepts a
Runnable object as an argument, which arranges to invoke the Runnable's run method when
the thread is started. While any class can implement Runnable, it often turns out to be both
convenient and helpful to define a Runnable as an anonymous inner class. 

The ParticleApplet class uses threads in this way to put particles into motion, and cancels
them when the applet is finished. This is done by overriding the standard Applet methods start
and stop (which have the same names as, but are unrelated to, methods Thread.start and
Thread.stop). 


----
1.1.2 Thread Mechanics 
----

A thread is a call sequence that executes independently of others, while at the same time possibly
sharing underlying system resources such as files, as well as accessing other objects constructed
within the same program (see § 1.2.2). A java.lang.Thread object maintains bookkeeping and
control for this activity. 

Every program consists of at least one thread — the one that runs the main method of the class
provided as a startup argument to the Java virtual machine ("JVM"). Other internal background
threads may also be started during JVM initialization. The number and nature of such threads vary
across JVM implementations. However, all user-level threads are explicitly constructed and started
from the main thread, or from any other threads that they in turn create. 

Here is a summary of the principal methods and properties of class Thread, as well as a few usage
notes. They are further discussed and illustrated throughout this book. The Java™ Language 
Specification ("JLS") and the published API documentation should be consulted for more detailed and
authoritative descriptions. 

----
1.1.2.1 Construction 
----

Different Thread constructors accept combinations of arguments supplying:
• A Runnable object, in which case a subsequent Thread.start invokes run of the
supplied Runnable object. If no Runnable is supplied, the default implementation of
Thread.run returns immediately.
• A String that serves as an identifier for the Thread. This can be useful for tracing and
debugging, but plays no other role.
• The ThreadGroup in which the new Thread should be placed. If access to the
ThreadGroup is not allowed, a SecurityException is thrown. 

Class Thread itself implements Runnable. So, rather than supplying the code to be run in a
Runnable and using it as an argument to a Thread constructor, you can create a subclass of
Thread that overrides the run method to perform the desired actions. However, the best default
strategy is to define a Runnable as a separate class and supply it in a Thread constructor.
Isolating code within a distinct class relieves you of worrying about any potential interactions of
synchronized methods or blocks used in the Runnable with any that may be used by
methods of class Thread. More generally, this separation allows independent control over the nature
of the action and the context in which it is run: The same Runnable can be supplied to threads that
are otherwise initialized in different ways, as well as to other lightweight executors (see § 4.1.4). Also
note that subclassing Thread precludes a class from subclassing any other class. 

Thread objects also possess a daemon status attribute that cannot be set via any Thread
constructor, but may be set only before a Thread is started. The method setDaemon asserts that
the JVM may exit, abruptly terminating the thread, so long as all other non-daemon threads in the
program have terminated. The isDaemon method returns status. The utility of daemon status is very
limited. Even background threads often need to do some cleanup upon program exit. (The spelling of
daemon, often pronounced as "day-mon", is a relic of systems programming tradition. System
daemons are continuous processes, for example print-queue managers, that are "always" present on a
system.)
