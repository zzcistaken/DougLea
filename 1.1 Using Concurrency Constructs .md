This section introduces basic concurrency support constructs by example and then proceeds with a
walk-through of the principal methods of class Thread. Other concurrency constructs are briefly 
described as they are introduced, but full technical details are postponed to later chapters (mainly §
2.2.1 and § 3.2.2). Also, concurrent programs often make use of a few ordinary Java programming
language features that are not as widely used elsewhere. These are briefly reviewed as they arise.

1.1.1 A Particle Applet 
----

Particle 英 ['pɑːtɪk(ə)l] n. 颗粒；[物] 质点；极小量；小品词

ParticleApplet is an Applet that displays randomly moving particles. In addition to
concurrency constructs, this example illustrates a few of the issues encountered when using threads
with any GUI-based program. The version described here needs a lot of embellishment to be visually
attractive or realistic. You might enjoy experimenting with additions and variations as an exercise.

experimenting 英 [ɪk'sperɪm(ə)nt; ek-] vi. 尝试；进行实验

As is typical of GUI-based programs, ParticleApplet uses several auxiliary classes that do
most of the work. We'll step through construction of the Particle and ParticleCanvas
classes before discussing ParticleApplet.

1.1.1.1 Particle 
----

The Particle class defines a completely unrealistic model of movable bodies. Each particle is
represented only by its (x, y) location. Each particle also supports a method to randomly change its
location and a method to draw itself (as a small square) given a supplied java.awt.Graphics
object. 

realistic 英 [rɪə'lɪstɪk] adj. 现实的；现实主义的；逼真的；实在论的

While Particle objects do not themselves exhibit any intrinsic concurrency, their methods may be
invoked across multiple concurrent activities. When one activity is performing a move and another is
invoking draw at about the same time, we'd like to make sure that the draw paints an accurate
representation of where the Particle is. Here, we require that draw uses the location values
current either before or after the move. For example, it would be conceptually wrong for a draw
operation to display using the y-value current before a given move, but the x-value current after the
move. If we were to allow this, then the draw method would sometimes display the particle at a
location that it never actually occupied. 

exhibit 美 [ɪɡ'zɪbɪt] 展览；显示；提出
intrinsic 英 [ɪn'trɪnsɪk] adj. 本质的，固有的

This protection can be obtained using the synchronized keyword, which can modify either a
method or a block of code. Every instance of class Object (and its subclasses) possesses a lock that
is obtained on entry to a synchronized method and automatically released upon exit. The codeblock version 
works in the same way except that it takes an argument stating which object to lock. The
most common argument is this, meaning to lock the object whose method is executing. When a
lock is held by one thread, other threads must block waiting for the holding thread to release the lock.
Locking has no effect on non-synchronized methods, which can execute even if the lock is being held
by another thread. 

Locking provides protection against both high-level and low-level conflicts by enforcing atomicity
among methods and code-blocks synchronized on the same object. Atomic actions are
performed as units, without any interleaving of the actions of other threads. But, as discussed in §
1.3.2 and in Chapter 2, too much locking can also produce liveness problems that cause programs to
freeze up. Rather than exploring these issues in detail now, we'll rely on some simple default rules for
writing methods that preclude interference problems: 

interleave 英 [ɪntə'liːv] vt. [计] 交错；插空白页于；插叙
preclude 英 [prɪ'kluːd] vt. 排除；妨碍；阻止

• Always lock during updates to object fields.
• Always lock during access of possibly updated object fields.
• Never lock when invoking methods on other objects.

These rules have many exceptions and refinements, but they provide enough guidance to write class
Particle:
import java.util.Random;
class Particle {
 protected int x;
 protected int y;
 protected final Random rng = new Random();
 public Particle(int initialX, int initialY) {
 x = initialX;
 y = initialY;
 }
 public synchronized void move() {
 x += rng.nextInt(10) - 5;
 y += rng.nextInt(20) - 10;
 }
 public void draw(Graphics g) {
 int lx, ly;
 synchronized (this) { lx = x; ly = y; }
 g.drawRect(lx, ly, 10, 10);
 }
}

Notes:
• The use of final in the declaration of the random number generator rng reflects our
decision that this reference field cannot be changed, so it is not impacted by our locking rules.
Many concurrent programs use final extensively, in part as helpful, automatically
enforced documentation of design decisions that reduce the need for synchronization (see §
2.1).
• The draw method needs to obtain a consistent snapshot of both the x and y values. Since a
single method can return only one value at a time, and we need both the x and y values here,
we cannot easily encapsulate the field accesses as a synchronized method. We instead
use a synchronized block. (See § 2.4 for some alternatives.)
• The draw method conforms to our rule of thumb to release locks during method invocations
on other objects (here g.drawRect). The move method appears to break this rule by
calling rng.nextInt. However, this is a reasonable choice here because each
Particle confines its own rng — conceptually, the rng is just a part of the
Particle itself, so it doesn't count as an "other" object in the rule. Section § 2.3 describes
more general conditions under which this sort of reasoning applies and discusses factors that
should be taken into account to be sure that this decision is warranted. 

conform 英 [kən'fɔːm] vi. 符合；遵照；适应环境


1.1.1.2 ParticleCanvas 
----

ParticleCanvas is a simple subclass of java.awt.Canvas that provides a drawing area
for all of the Particles. Its main responsibility is to invoke draw for all existing particles
whenever its paint method is called. 

However, the ParticleCanvas itself does not create or manage the particles. It needs either to
be told about them or to ask about them. Here, we choose the former. 

The instance variable particles holds the array of existing Particle objects. This field is set
when necessary by the applet, but is used in the paint method. We can again apply our default
rules, which in this case lead to the creation of little synchronized get and set methods (also
known as accessor and assignment methods) for particles, otherwise avoiding direct access of
the particles variable itself. To simplify and to enforce proper usage, the particles field is
never allowed to be null. It is instead initialized to an empty array: 

class ParticleCanvas extends Canvas {
  private Particle[] particles = new Particle[0];
  
  ParticleCanvas(int size) {
    setSize(new Dimension(size, size));
  }
  
  // intended to be called by applet
  protected synchronized void setParticles(Particle[] ps) {
    if (ps == null)
      throw new IllegalArgumentException("Cannot set null");
    particles = ps;
  } 
 
  protected synchronized Particle[] getParticles() {
    return particles;
  }
  
  public void paint(Graphics g) { // override Canvas.paint
    Particle[] ps = getParticles();
    for (int i = 0; i < ps.length; ++i)
    ps[i].draw(g);
  }
} 



1.1.1.3 ParticleApplet 
----

The Particle and ParticleCanvas classes could be used as the basis of several different
programs. But in ParticleApplet all we want to do is set each of a collection of particles in
autonomous "continuous" motion and update the display accordingly to show where they are. To
comply with standard applet conventions, these activities should begin when Applet.start is
externally invoked (normally from within a web browser), and should end when Applet.stop is
invoked. (We could also add buttons allowing users to start and stop the particle animation
themselves.) 

There are several ways to implement all this. Among the simplest is to associate an independent loop
with each particle and to run each looping action in a different thread.

Actions to be performed within new threads must be defined in classes implementing
java.lang.Runnable. This interface lists only the single method run, taking no arguments,
returning no results, and throwing no checked exceptions: 

public interface java.lang.Runnable {
 void run();
} 

An interface encapsulates a coherent set of services and attributes (broadly, a role) without
assigning this functionality to any particular object or code. Interfaces are more abstract than classes
since they say nothing at all about representations or code. All they do is describe the signatures
(names, arguments, result types, and exceptions) of public operations, without even pinning down the
classes of the objects that can perform them. The classes that can support Runnable typically have
nothing in common except that they contain a run method. 

Each instance of the Thread class maintains the control state necessary to execute and manage the
call sequence comprising its action. The most commonly used constructor in class Thread accepts a
Runnable object as an argument, which arranges to invoke the Runnable's run method when
the thread is started. While any class can implement Runnable, it often turns out to be both
convenient and helpful to define a Runnable as an anonymous inner class. 

The ParticleApplet class uses threads in this way to put particles into motion, and cancels
them when the applet is finished. This is done by overriding the standard Applet methods start
and stop (which have the same names as, but are unrelated to, methods Thread.start and
Thread.stop). 


----
1.1.2 Thread Mechanics 
----

A thread is a call sequence that executes independently of others, while at the same time possibly
sharing underlying system resources such as files, as well as accessing other objects constructed
within the same program (see § 1.2.2). A java.lang.Thread object maintains bookkeeping and
control for this activity. 

Every program consists of at least one thread — the one that runs the main method of the class
provided as a startup argument to the Java virtual machine ("JVM"). Other internal background
threads may also be started during JVM initialization. The number and nature of such threads vary
across JVM implementations. However, all user-level threads are explicitly constructed and started
from the main thread, or from any other threads that they in turn create. 

Here is a summary of the principal methods and properties of class Thread, as well as a few usage
notes. They are further discussed and illustrated throughout this book. The Java™ Language 
Specification ("JLS") and the published API documentation should be consulted for more detailed and
authoritative descriptions. 


1.1.2.1 Construction 
----

Different Thread constructors accept combinations of arguments supplying:
• A Runnable object, in which case a subsequent Thread.start invokes run of the
supplied Runnable object. If no Runnable is supplied, the default implementation of
Thread.run returns immediately.
• A String that serves as an identifier for the Thread. This can be useful for tracing and
debugging, but plays no other role.
• The ThreadGroup in which the new Thread should be placed. If access to the
ThreadGroup is not allowed, a SecurityException is thrown. 

Class Thread itself implements Runnable. So, rather than supplying the code to be run in a
Runnable and using it as an argument to a Thread constructor, you can create a subclass of
Thread that overrides the run method to perform the desired actions. However, the best default
strategy is to define a Runnable as a separate class and supply it in a Thread constructor.
Isolating code within a distinct class relieves you of worrying about any potential interactions of
synchronized methods or blocks used in the Runnable with any that may be used by
methods of class Thread. More generally, this separation allows independent control over the nature
of the action and the context in which it is run: The same Runnable can be supplied to threads that
are otherwise initialized in different ways, as well as to other lightweight executors (see § 4.1.4). Also
note that subclassing Thread precludes a class from subclassing any other class. 

Thread objects also possess a daemon status attribute that cannot be set via any Thread
constructor, but may be set only before a Thread is started. The method setDaemon asserts that
the JVM may exit, abruptly terminating the thread, so long as all other non-daemon threads in the
program have terminated. The isDaemon method returns status. The utility of daemon status is very
limited. Even background threads often need to do some cleanup upon program exit. (The spelling of
daemon, often pronounced as "day-mon", is a relic of systems programming tradition. System
daemons are continuous processes, for example print-queue managers, that are "always" present on a
system.) 


1.1.2.2 Starting threads 
----

Invoking its start method causes an instance of class Thread to initiate its run method as an
independent activity. None of the synchronization locks held by the caller thread are held by the new
thread (see § 2.2.1). 

A Thread terminates when its run method completes by either returning normally or throwing an
unchecked exception (i.e., RuntimeException, Error, or one of their subclasses). Threads
are not restartable, even after they terminate. Invoking start more than once results in an
InvalidThreadStateException. 

The method isAlive returns true if a thread has been started but has not terminated. It will
return true if the thread is merely blocked in some way. JVM implementations have been known to
differ in the exact point at which isAlive returns false for threads that have been cancelled (see 
§ 3.1.2). There is no method that tells you whether a thread that is not isAlive has ever been
started. Also, one thread cannot readily determine which other thread started it, although it may
determine the identities of other threads in its ThreadGroup (see § 1.1.2.6). 


1.1.2.3 Priorities 
----

To make it possible to implement the Java virtual machine across diverse hardware platforms and
operating systems, the Java programming language makes no promises about scheduling or fairness,
and does not even strictly guarantee that threads make forward progress (see § 3.4.1.5). But threads do
support priority methods that heuristically influence schedulers:
• Each Thread has a priority, ranging between Thread.MIN_PRIORITY and
Thread.MAX_PRIORITY (defined as 1 and 10 respectively).
• By default, each new thread has the same priority as the thread that created it. The initial
thread associated with a main by default has priority Thread.NORM_PRIORITY (5).
• The current priority of any thread can be accessed via method getPriority.
• The priority of any thread can be dynamically changed via method setPriority. The
maximum allowed priority for a thread is bounded by its ThreadGroup. 

When more runnable (see § 1.3.2) threads than available CPUs, a scheduler is generally biased to
prefer running those with higher priorities. The exact policy may and does vary across platforms. For
example, some JVM implementations always select the thread with the highest current priority (with
ties broken arbitrarily). Some JVM implementations map the ten Thread priorities into a smaller
number of system-supported categories, so threads with different priorities may be treated equally.
And some mix declared priorities with aging schemes or other scheduling policies to ensure that even
low-priority threads eventually get a chance to run. Also, setting priorities may, but need not, affect
scheduling with respect to other programs running on the same computer system. 

Priorities have no other bearing on semantics or correctness (see § 1.3). In particular, priority
manipulations cannot be used as a substitute for locking. Priorities can be used only to express the
relative importance or urgency of different threads, where these priority indications would be useful to
take into account when there is heavy contention among threads trying to get a chance to execute. For
example, setting the priorities of the particle animation threads in ParticleApplet below that of
the applet thread constructing them might on some systems improve responsiveness to mouse clicks,
and would at least not hurt responsiveness on others. But programs should be designed to run correctly
(although perhaps not as responsively) even if setPriority is defined as a no-op. (Similar
remarks hold for yield; see § 1.1.2.5.) 

The following table gives one set of general conventions for linking task categories to priority
settings. In many concurrent applications, relatively few threads are actually runnable at any given
time (others are all blocked in some way), in which case there is little reason to manipulate priorities.
In other cases, minor tweaks in priority settings may play a small part in the final tuning of a
concurrent system. 

Range Use
10 Crisis management
7-9 Interactive, event-driven
4-6 IO-bound
2-3 Background computation 
1 Run only if nothing else can 


1.1.2.4 Control methods
----

Only a few methods are available for communicating across threads:
• Each Thread has an associated boolean interruption status (see § 3.1.2). Invoking
t.interrupt for some Thread t sets t's interruption status to true, unless
Thread t is engaged in Object.wait, Thread.sleep, or Thread.join; in
this case interrupt causes these actions (in t) to throw InterruptedException,
but t's interruption status is set to false.
• The interruption status of any Thread can be inspected using method isInterrupted.
This method returns true if the thread has been interrupted via the interrupt method
but the status has not since been reset either by the thread invoking
Thread.interrupted (see § 1.1.2.5) or in the course of wait, sleep, or join
throwing InterruptedException.
• Invoking t.join() for Thread t suspends the caller until the target Thread t
completes: the call to t.join() returns when t.isAlive() is false (see § 4.3.2).
A version with a (millisecond) time argument returns control even if the thread has not
completed within the specified time limit. Because of how isAlive is defined, it makes no
sense to invoke join on a thread that has not been started. For similar reasons, it is unwise
to try to join a Thread that you did not create. 

Originally, class Thread supported the additional control methods suspend, resume, stop,
and destroy. Methods suspend, resume, and stop have since been deprecated; method
destroy has never been implemented in any release and probably never will be. The effects of
methods suspend and resume can be obtained more safely and reliably using the waiting and
notification techniques discussed in § 3.2. The problems surrounding stop are discussed in § 3.1.2.3. 


1.1.2.5 Static methods 
----

Some Thread class methods can be applied only to the thread that is currently running (i.e., the
thread making the call to the Thread method). To enforce this, these methods are declared as
static.
• Thread.currentThread returns a reference to the current Thread. This reference
may then be used to invoke other (non-static) methods. For example,
Thread.currentThread().getPriority() returns the priority of the thread
making the call.
• Thread.interrupted clears interruption status of the current Thread and returns
previous status. (Thus, one Thread's interruption status cannot be cleared from other
threads.)
• Thread.sleep(long msecs) causes the current thread to suspend for at least
msecs milliseconds (see § 3.2.2).
• Thread.yield is a purely heuristic hint advising the JVM that if there are any other
runnable but non-running threads, the scheduler should run one or more of these threads
rather than the current thread. The JVM may interpret this hint in any way it likes. 

Despite the lack of guarantees, yield can be pragmatically effective on some single-CPU JVM
implementations that do not use time-sliced pre-emptive scheduling (see § 1.2.2). In this case, threads
are rescheduled only when one blocks (for example on IO, or via sleep). On these systems, threads
that perform time-consuming non-blocking computations can tie up a CPU for extended periods,
decreasing the responsiveness of an application. As a safeguard, methods performing non-blocking
computations that might exceed acceptable response times for event handlers or other reactive threads
can insert yields (or perhaps even sleeps) and, when desirable, also run at lower priority
settings. To minimize unnecessary impact, you can arrange to invoke yield only occasionally; for
example, a loop might contain:
 if (Math.random() < 0.01) Thread.yield();
On JVM implementations that employ pre-emptive scheduling policies, especially those on
multiprocessors, it is possible and even desirable that the scheduler will simply ignore this hint
provided by yield. 


1.1.2.6 ThreadGroups
----

Every Thread is constructed as a member of a ThreadGroup, by default the same group as that
of the Thread issuing the constructor for it. ThreadGroups nest in a tree-like fashion. When an
object constructs a new ThreadGroup, it is nested under its current group. The method
getThreadGroup returns the group of any thread. The ThreadGroup class in turn supports
methods such as enumerate that indicate which threads are currently in the group.
One purpose of class ThreadGroup is to support security policies that dynamically restrict access
to Thread operations; for example, to make it illegal to interrupt a thread that is not in your
group. This is one part of a set of protective measures against problems that could occur, for example,
if an applet were to try to kill the main screen display update thread. ThreadGroups may also
place a ceiling on the maximum priority that any member thread can possess.
ThreadGroups tend not to be used directly in thread-based programs. In most applications,
normal collection classes (for example java.util.Vector) are better choices for tracking
groups of Thread objects for application-dependent purposes.
Among the few ThreadGroup methods that commonly come into play in concurrent programs is
method uncaughtException, which is invoked when a thread in a group terminates due to an
uncaught unchecked exception (for example a NullPointerException). This method
normally causes a stack trace to be printed.
