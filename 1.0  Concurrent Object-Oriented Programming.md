This book discusses some ways of thinking about, designing, and implementing concurrent programs
in the Java™ programming language. Most presentations in this book assume that you are an
experienced developer familiar with object-oriented (OO) programming, but have little exposure to
concurrency. Readers with the opposite background — experience with concurrency in other
languages — may also find this book useful. 

exposure 美 [ɪk'spoʒɚ] n. 暴露；曝光；揭露；陈列

The book is organized into four coarse-grained chapters. (Perhaps parts would be a better term.) This
first chapter begins with a brief tour of some frequently used constructs and then backs up to establish
a conceptual basis for concurrent object-oriented programming: how concurrency and objects fit
together, how the resulting design forces impact construction of classes and components, and how
some common design patterns can be used to structure solutions. 

coarse 英 [kɔːs] adj. 粗糙的；粗俗的；下等的
grain 英 [greɪn] n. 粮食；颗粒；[作物] 谷物；纹理 vi. 成谷粒
coarse-grained adj. 粗鲁的；木纹粗糙的
establish 美 [ɪˈstæblɪʃ] vt. 建立；创办；安置

The three subsequent chapters are centered around use (and evasion) of the three kinds of concurrency
constructs found in the Java programming language: 

subsequent 美 ['sʌbsɪkwənt] adj. 后来的，随后的
evasion 英 [ɪ'veɪʒ(ə)n] n. 逃避；回避；借口

Exclusion. Maintaining consistent states of objects by preventing unwanted interference among
concurrent activities, often using synchronized methods. 

Exclusion 美 [ɪk'skluʒn] n. 排除；排斥；驱逐；被排除在外的事物
interference 英 [ɪntə'fɪər(ə)ns] n. 干扰，冲突；干涉

State dependence. Triggering, preventing, postponing, or recovering from actions depending on
whether objects are in states in which these actions could or did succeed, sometimes using monitor
methods Object.wait, Object.notify, and Object.notifyAll. 

Triggering n. [电子] 触发；起动
postponing 英 ['pəust'pəuniŋ] n. 推迟

Creating threads. Establishing and managing concurrency, using Thread objects. 

Each chapter contains a sequence of major sections, each on an independent topic. They present 
highlevel design principles and strategies, technical details surrounding constructs, utilities that
encapsulate common usages, and associated design patterns that address particular concurrency
problems. Most sections conclude with an annotated set of further readings providing more
information on selected topics. The online supplement to this book contains links to additional online
resources, as well as updates, errata, and code examples. It is accessible via links from:

If you are already familiar with the basics, you can read this book in the presented order to explore
each topic in more depth. But most readers will want to read this book in various different orders.
Because most concurrency concepts and techniques interact with most others, it is not always possible
to understand each section or chapter in complete isolation from all the others. However, you can still
take a breadth-first approach, briefly scanning each chapter (including this one) before proceeding
with more detailed coverage of interest. Many presentations later in the book can be approached after
selectively reading through earlier material indicated by extensive cross-references.
