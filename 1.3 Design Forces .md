This section surveys design concerns that arise in concurrent software development, but play at best
minor roles in sequential programming. Most presentations of constructions and design patterns later
in this book include descriptions of how they resolve applicable forces discussed here (as well as
others that are less directly tied to concurrency, such as accuracy, testability, and so on). 

One can take two complementary views of any OO system, object-centric and activity-centric: 

Under an object-centric view, a system is a collection of interconnected objects. But it is a structured
collection, not a random object soup. Objects cluster together in groups, for example the group of
objects comprising a ParticleApplet, thus forming larger components and subsystems. 

Under an activity-centric view, a system is a collection of possibly concurrent activities. At the most
fine-grained level, these are just individual message sends (normally, method invocations). They in
turn organize themselves into sets of call-chains, event sequences, tasks, sessions, transactions, and
threads. One logical activity (such as running the ParticleApplet) may involve many threads.
At a higher level, some of these activities represent system-wide use cases. 

Neither view alone provides a complete picture of a system, since a given object may be involved in
multiple activities, and conversely a given activity may span multiple objects. However, these two
views give rise to two complementary sets of correctness concerns, one object-centric and the other
activity-centric: 

Safety. Nothing bad ever happens to an object. 

Liveness. Something eventually happens within an activity. 

Safety failures lead to unintended behavior at run time — things just start going wrong. Liveness
failures lead to no behavior — things just stop running. Sadly enough, some of the easiest things you
can do to improve liveness properties can destroy safety properties, and vice versa. Getting them both
right can be a challenge. 

You have to balance the relative effects of different kinds of failure in your own programs. But it is a
standard engineering (not just software engineering) practice to place primary design emphasis on
safety. The more your code actually matters, the better it is to ensure that a program does nothing at all
rather than something that leads to random, even dangerous behavior. 

On the other hand, most of the time spent tuning concurrent designs in practice usually surrounds
liveness and liveness-related efficiency issues. And there are sometimes good, conscientious reasons
for selectively sacrificing safety for liveness. For example, it may be acceptable for visual displays to
transiently show utter nonsense due to uncoordinated concurrent execution— drawing stray pixels,
incorrect progress indicators, or images that bear no relation to their intended forms — if you are
confident that this state of affairs will soon be corrected. 

Safety and liveness issues may be further extended to encompass two categories of quality concerns,
one mainly object-centric and the other mainly activity-centric, that are also sometimes in direct
opposition: 

Reusability. The utility of objects and classes across multiple contexts.

Performance. The extent to which activities execute soon and quickly. 

The remainder of this section looks more closely at safety, liveness, performance, and reusability in
concurrent programs. It presents basic terms and definitions, along with brief introductions to core
issues and tactics that are revisited and amplified throughout the course of this book.
